These actions involve the sokoban character pushing crates in specific directions, which is essential for solving puzzles. The effectiveness of these actions is contingent upon the state of the game environment, particularly the availability of clear paths and the positioning of crates. Understanding these actions is crucial for developing AI strategies that can navigate and solve Sokoban puzzles efficiently.

The actions PUSHLEFT and PUSHRIGHT directly involve the crates, indicating that the success of these actions is dependent on the crates' positions and the surrounding environment. For instance, if a crate is positioned in a way that blocks the sokoban's path, the player must strategize to move the crate before executing further actions. This relationship highlights the importance of spatial awareness in both human and AI gameplay.

The AT predicate confirms the current positions of the sokoban and the crate, ensuring that the player can make informed decisions about their next moves. Meanwhile, the CLEAR predicate ensures that the destination location is unoccupied, which is essential for successful crate movement. These predicates introduce a layer of complexity to the game, as players must constantly assess the state of the environment before executing actions.
