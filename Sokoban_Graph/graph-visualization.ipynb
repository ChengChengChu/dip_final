This duality highlights the strategic element of the game, where players must consider the placement and movement of crates to solve puzzles effectively.|5\\n38|GOAL|The goal is a specific condition that must be achieved in the game, which in this case is having crate1 at location l9 and crate2 at location l2.|2\\n35|CRATE1|The crate1 is an object that can be pushed by the sokoban2 within the game environment, initially located at position l9.|3\\n34|SOKOBAN2|The sokoban2 is an object representing the player or character in the game, responsible for pushing crates and navigating the environment.|11\\n36|CRATE2|The crate2 is another object that can be pushed by the sokoban2, initially located at position l15.|4\\n13|CLEAR|The predicate \\'clear\\' indicates whether a location is unoccupied and available for movement or pushing actions, which is crucial for the sokoban\\'s actions.|2\\n7|MOVEUP|The action \\'moveUp\\' allows the sokoban to move from one location to another, specifically from a lower location to a higher one, given certain conditions are met.|3\\n8|MOVEDOWN|The action \\'moveDown\\' allows the sokoban to move from a higher location to a lower one, contingent on specific preconditions.|3\\n12|AT|The predicate \\'at\\' indicates the relationship between an object and its current location, specifying where the sokoban or crate is positioned in the game environment.|2\\n5|MOVELEFT|The action \\'moveLeft\\' allows the sokoban to move from one location to another, specifically to a location that is to the left of its current position, given certain conditions are met.|3\\n17|X|Location x is a position in the game where the sokoban is initially located before pushing the crate.|1\\n6|MOVERIGHT|The action \\'moveRight\\' allows the sokoban to move from one location to another, specifically to a location that is to the right of its current position, contingent on specific preconditions.|3\\n10|PUSHRIGHT|The action of moving a crate to the right towards location z, indicating a spatial manipulation in a game environment.|5\\n9|PUSHLEFT|The action of moving a crate to the left towards location z, indicating a spatial manipulation in a game environment.|5\\n4|LOCATION Z|Location z is a target position in the game where the crate can be pushed to, indicating a spatial manipulation.|4\\n2|LOCATION X|Location x is a position in the game where the sokoban or crate can be located, serving as a reference point for movement.|2\\n15|PUSHUP|The action of moving a crate upwards to a higher location, indicating a spatial manipulation in a game environment.|4\\n3|LOCATION Y|Location y is a position in the game where the sokoban or crate can be located, often used in relation to other locations.|6\\n24|L9|L9 is a defined point within the game environment that serves to establish spatial relationships among various elements in the game.
