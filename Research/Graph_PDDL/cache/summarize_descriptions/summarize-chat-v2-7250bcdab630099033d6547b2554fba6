{"result": "Graph transformation systems are computational models designed to manipulate graphs based on specified rules. They are commonly utilized in planning and problem-solving contexts, as well as in modeling both software and hardware systems. By applying formal rules, these systems facilitate the transformation of graphs, enabling a structured approach to various computational tasks.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
