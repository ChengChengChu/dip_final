{"result": "PDDL, which stands for Planning Domain Definition Language, is a formal language utilized in artificial intelligence for describing planning problems and domains. Developed in 1998, PDDL was created to standardize planning languages, allowing for a consistent way to express planning problems and actions. It serves as a crucial tool for AI planning, enabling the formal representation of various planning scenarios and domain definitions. Overall, PDDL is recognized as a key language in the field of AI for articulating planning challenges and their respective domains.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
