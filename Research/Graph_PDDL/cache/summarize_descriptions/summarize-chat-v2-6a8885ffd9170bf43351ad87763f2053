{"result": "State space refers to the comprehensive set of all possible states that can be reached in a planning problem, particularly within the context of artificial intelligence (AI) planning. It encompasses various configurations of a system, where nodes symbolize individual states and edges illustrate the transitions between these states. The state space can be explored and analyzed using a variety of algorithms, allowing for the determination of potential outcomes resulting from different actions taken within the planning problem.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
