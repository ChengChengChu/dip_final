DEFINITIONS The following terms may cause confusion, so to be clear we will briefly explain them. Action Description of a possible action, using preconditions and effects. Creator An edge or node that will be added to the graph by applying a graph rule. Domain Description of the problem setting, including possible predicates and actions. Effect Description of the effects of an action, using Predicates and logical operators such as and and not. Embargo An edge or node that cannot be present to apply a graph rule. Eraser An edge or node that will be removed from the graph by applying a graph rule. Event The application of an action, indicating which objects are used as arguments. Goal The desired end state, to which a plan should lead. Graph rule Description of graph transformations to be taken when a (sub)graph matches the given readers and embargoes. Graph transformation Transformations to be applied to a graph, expressed in creators and erasers. Object Instances in the domain that can have predicates. Plan A sequence of events that leads from the initial state to the goal state. Planner A tool that delivers a plan, given a domain and a problem. Precondition Description of a precondition of an action, using predicates and logical operators such as and and not. Predicate An attribute of an object, or a relation between multiple objects. Problem Description of the start state, using predicates Reader An edge or node that must be present to apply a graph rule. State A possible configuration of objects and predicates. State space All possible states. Translation A (systematic) way to express a state or action as a graph or graph rule respectively, or the other way around. B.
