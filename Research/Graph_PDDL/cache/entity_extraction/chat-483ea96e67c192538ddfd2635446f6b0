Introduction The classical approaches to AI Planning use state-space and plan-space to search solution plans to solve planning problems. In the state-space searching, the initial world state goes through several transformations by applying applicable actions until a solution plan is found to reach the goal or the search algorithm terminates and returns failure. We can use the search algorithms such as BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, A*, and others. None State-Space (Image by Author) The resulting solution plan is a sequence of actions that when applied transforms the initial world state to the goal state in one or more steps. None State-space Plan (Image by Author) Another search space is plan-space where we have plans as our nodes and try to solve the flaws in the forms of open (unsolved) goals and threats. None Plan-space Planning (Image by Author) This approach is quite complex in itself we are not going to discuss the details here, if you're interested in understanding more, you can read this post: Plan-Space Search Searching for a solution plan in plan-space rather than state-space, another approach to solve planning problems. Improving the size of the space In the book \"Automated Planning: Theory and Practice\", Malik, Dana, and Paolo mention that the researches in classical approaches stalled due to the expressiveness and complexity reasons, the planning graph \u2014 a new search space, allows the improvement of the size of the search space hence opens a way to solve more complex planning problems. We will look into the details in the following sections below to understand how it improves the issues found in the classical planning approaches. The Dock-Worker Robots Planning Domain For our examples, we will use the Simplified Dock-Worker Robots (DWR) domain and problem, often used in the AI Planning Tutorial. None Simple Dock-Worker Robots Domain (Image by Author) In this domain, we have two robots, robr and robq, two containers, conta and contb, and two locations, loc1 and loc2. There are three possible actions: load(location, container, robot): loading a container onto a robot move(location, location): moving from one location to another unload(location, container, robot): unloading a container from a robot The details of preconditions and effects of the actions can be seen in the pddl file below. We also have five predicates for us to represent the states: adjacent(loc1, loc2) \u2014 this is a static information about locations atl(robot, location) \u2014 describing the location of the robot loaded(robot, container) \u2014 whether a robot is loaded and which container is on the robot unloaded(robot) \u2014 the robot is unloaded in(container, location) \u2014 describing the location of a container We use PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) to represent our planning domain and planning problem. Below is the pddl file for our domain of interest. Now let's start diving into Planning Graph and its Planner. Planning Graph The Planning graph is based on the idea of reachability analysis, which is a process of computing whether a set of states is reachable or not from an initial set of states. Let's go through an example step-by-step to understand the concept. First, this is our initial state: None Initial state (Image by Author) We represent our world state using predicates (we omit the adjacent predicate for simplicity): in(conta, loc1) in(contb, loc2) atl(robr, loc1) atl(robq, loc2) unloaded(robr) unloaded(robq) We want to know whether this state is reachable or not: None Goal state (Image by Author) We are not showing the robots in the picture, because we don't care where their locations are, we're only interested in the containers' locations. We represent it in this way: in(contb, loc1) in(conta, loc2) Reachability Tree Now, the simplest way is to use the Reachability Tree. We start with an initial state (root node), search for applicable actions for the state (edges), and then we generate the predicted states (child nodes), and we repeat the process for all child nodes\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
