Correctness of the translation. The circles on left right are graph states, The boxes on the right are planner states. The solid vertical arrows are action- and rule applications and the dotted horizontal arrows are translations tem based on the ferryman problem5 , which can be found in appendix C, and exported it to PDDL descriptions. We chose not to use the wumpus problem again, because the generated graphs cannot be translated back because of the existential quantifiers for the erasers, and a new problem enabled us to test another example on-the-fly, as the generated PDDL code could be translated back to graphs. Parts of the generated PDDL files can be found in Appendix D. Limitations The translation from graph system to PDDL has some limitations, as mentioned earlier in this paper. Additionally, some extra clarifications are needed for the translator to work properly: \u2022 Because GROOVE saves node labels as self-edges, the translator cannot distinguish the difference between the name of an object, and a predicate with one parameter. Therefor, it is necessary to make node labels stand out by adding the prefix flag:. These self-edges will be interpreted as the names of the objects, self-edges without this prefix are considered to be predicates. \u2022 There can only be one start graph, and this graph should describe the problem using labeled nodes. \u2022 One of the rules has to be named goal and must describe the desired end state, using only nodes with a flag label, readers and embargoes. \u2022 Existential quantifiers are needed to make the erasers work properly, but these structures are not recognized by the translator from graphs to PDDL and will generate unforeseen results. \u2022 Object creation and deletion is not possible in PDDL, so the graph rules cannot have any creator or eraser nodes. 8. CONCLUSION 8.1 Reflection on problem statement How can problem descriptions in PDDL and graph transformation systems be translated correctly? The translation from PDDL to graphs, as suggested in sections 6.1 and 7.1 did not only lead to a working translator, it even showcased one of the biggest advantages of a translator by unveiling several shortcomings in the example PDDL code. The other translation, from graphs to PDDL works as well, although it still has some of limitations. 5Also known as the Fox, goose and bag of beans puzzle, but in this case we use a wolf, a goat and cabbage. When can a translation be called \u2018correct\u2019? The extensive process of validating and testing, as described in sections 6.2 and 7.2, indicates that the label \u2018correct\u2019 is in place. How can a translation be implemented in GROOVE? We used as much built-in methods of GROOVE as possible, so we didn\u2019t have to do anything ourselves that GROOVE already did. 8.2 Future work This research only scratched the surface of the possibilities. There is a lot of potential in the produced translators, but there is still much left to do: Extra requirements. Several options (requirements) of PDDL are left unimplemented and untested. The translator should be extended to handle more requirements like typing and equality. Optimization. The translation is quite naive at some points. For example, an existential quantifier is created regardless of the presence of a reader which forces the edge to be present before applying the rule. This renders the quantifier useless. For the translation back however, this quantifier is quite a burden as it prevents the rule from being translated properly. The same goes for predicates with 3 or more parameters. These are translated into a node with numbered edges to the object-nodes. This structure cannot be translated back because the generation of objects is not supported in PDDL, but the translator does not recognize this structure to interpret it as a multi-object predicate. In short, if the translator would recognize patterns in the graph rules, it should be able to identify them and create the respective PDDL construction instead of giving an error. This would increase the number of graphs that are translatable to PDDL. 8.3 Availability The translators will be incorporated in one of the next releases of the GROOVE tool (urlgroove.cs.utwente.nl). As GROOVE is an open source project, the sources of the translator will become public at the same time. All the PDDL files and GROOVE grammars mentioned in this paper, both as input and generated, can be found on www.ronaldm.nl/pddl-groove. 9. REFERENCES [1] S. Edelkamp.
