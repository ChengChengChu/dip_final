After we have solved them, we recursively use the preconditions of the actions as sub-goal until we reach P0. None Searching Backwards (Image by Author) One important thing that we skipped was that at every level we have Dummy Actions that do nothing \u2014 their preconditions and effects are the same. This allows the algorithm to work smoothly for those propositions that are already satisfied in the lower level. For our example, our solution plan is: Level 1: {load(loc2, contb, robq), load(loc1, conta, robr)} Level 2: {move(robq, loc2, loc1), move(robr, loc1, loc2)} Level 3: {unload(loc1, contb, robq), unload(loc2, conta, robr)} Conclusion We hopefully now understand how we can improve the complexity of classical planning approaches by using the Planning Graph approach. The Planning Graph is more complex to build compared to the Reachability Tree and the Reachability Graph but it saves us size and time in searching the solution as demonstrated in the step-by-step example. I hope that you understand the concept and in the next post, we'll implement this approach in Python to prove that it works and help us further in understanding it.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PLANNING GRAPH<|>EVENT<|>The Planning Graph is a method used to improve the complexity of classical planning approaches in artificial intelligence, allowing for more efficient solution searching.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REACHABILITY TREE<|>EVENT<|>The Reachability Tree is a simpler method for planning in AI, but less efficient than the Planning Graph.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REACHABILITY GRAPH<|>EVENT<|>The Reachability Graph is another method for planning in AI, similar to the Reachability Tree but with different structural properties.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROBOTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Robots are automated machines used in various tasks, including loading and unloading containers in planning scenarios.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOCATIONS<|>GEO<|>Locations refer to specific places where actions such as loading and unloading occur in the planning example.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PLANNING GRAPH<|>REACHABILITY TREE<|>The Planning Graph is a more complex alternative to the Reachability Tree for solving planning problems<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PLANNING GRAPH<|>REACHABILITY GRAPH<|>The Planning Graph is a more complex alternative to the Reachability Graph for solving planning problems<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROBOTS<|>LOCATIONS<|>Robots perform actions such as loading and unloading at specific locations<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
