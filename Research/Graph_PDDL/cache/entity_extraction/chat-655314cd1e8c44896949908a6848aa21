PDDL code with two contradicting effects graph rules for all other actions were applicable to the first graph and resulted in the respective end graphs. To fully test the possibilities, we have designed and built a compiler that reads PDDL-files into GROOVE, automatically representing the problem with graphs and graph rules. To test the compiler, we made GROOVE to come up with a plan for the wumpus problem as described in listing 1 and 2. The resulting graphs are shown in appendix B. The translator worked properly on the given example: the resulting graph rules reflect the described actions in PDDL, the same goes for the start graph and the goal. The state space however, shows no less than 27 end states. A quick analysis of those states learns that the original PDDL description is not as complete as it appears: \u2022 For the agent, it is forbidden to move to a square with a wumpus on it. The wumpus however, is not restricted in its moves and has no problem moving onto a square with the agent on it. \u2022 The agent can not only take the treasure, but also the wumpus when it is on the same square. Even if the previously mentioned problem is solved, the agent can pick up a dead wumpus, because a wumpus stays on its square when dying. By taking a wumpus alive however, the predicate wumpus-in remains, causing unexpected results later as the square has become inaccessible for the agent. \u2022 \u2018stays\u2019 on its square is not completely true. The move-wumpus action does not check whether the wumpus is still alive or not, so even a dead wumpus is able to wander around the field. All these factors introduce new possible states in which the goal is satisfied, which were probably never found by traditional planners. This is a showcase of the advantages of graph-based problem solving, immediately showing the potential of a good integration between the two systems. Limitations The translator is limited to the use of STRIPS, without any of the additional requirements. 7. TRANSLATION GRAPHS TO PDDL We will now describe the translation from graph transformation systems in GROOVE to PDDL descriptions. First we will explain the theoretical background (section 7.1), followed by a test plan and the results (section 7.2 and 7.3). 7.1 Theory The translation as described in section 6.1 works pretty much the same way for the other way around. A big difference however, is that PDDL does not support the creation and/or deletion of objects, while it is possible to create nodes as creators and erasers in GROOVE. As Edelkamp [1] mentioned, additional action effects that create or delete an object would not only help for this problem, but would also be desirable for several other planning purposes. But of course altering PDDL is not feasible within the scope of this research, so we will limit the translation to graph transformation systems without node creations. As a result, PDDL descriptions using predicates of 3 or more parameters can be translated to graphs, but because such a predicate means a node creation in graphs, the translation back to PDDL is impossible. The fact that an eraser in GROOVE also acts as a reader, has to be taken into account in this translation as well. Luckily, this solution is much simpler, and an extra precondition is enough to simulate the reader-behavior of an eraser. Another difference between the two systems is in the handling of the effects. GROOVE handles every eraser before it handles all the creators, but PDDL effects are formulated as a kind of post-condition, without any order of execution. Because of this, GROOVE can have \u2018contradicting\u2019 effects (e.g. a creator and an eraser for the same edge), but in PDDL this would mean the predicate is both present and absent after the application of an action. Ignoring the questionable usefulness of such rules, the solution is to detect these kind of structures and replace them with a reader (again, to simulate the reader-behavior of the eraser). The result is of course no problem for PDDL, while graphs that are produced stay the same. Figure 10a and 10b show two graph rules with the same behavior. The first one results in unusable PDDL code (listing 5), while the second one produces valid code. A B a b b (a) not translatable A B b a (b) translatable Figure 10. Graph rules with the same behavior :precondition ( (a ?A ?B) ) :effect ( and((b ?A ?B) not (b ?A ?B)) ) Listing 5. translated PDDL code 7.2 Testing The test plan of this translation is analogous to the one described in section 6.2, but of course the other way around as shown in figure 11: 7.3 Results All these tests were executed and showed no other problems than the ones mentioned in section 7.2, again indicating the translation to be correct. Additionally, we created a basic graph transformation syss0 T , T(s0) a T , \u000f\u000f T(a) \u000f\u000f s1 T , T(s1) Figure 11. Correctness of the translation.

The solid vertical arrows are action- and rule applications and the dotted horizontal arrows are translations tem based on the ferryman problem5 , which can be found in appendix C, and exported it to PDDL descriptions. We chose not to use the wumpus problem again, because the generated graphs cannot be translated back because of the existential quantifiers for the erasers,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
