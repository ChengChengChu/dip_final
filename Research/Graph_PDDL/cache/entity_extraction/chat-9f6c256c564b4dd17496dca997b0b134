List of actions The possible actions are described with their names, parameters, preconditions and effects. Both the preconditions and the effects are optional: an action without preconditions can always be applied, an action without effects doesn\u2019t change anything but only checks whether some conditions are true. Both the preconditions and the effects are described in terms of predicates, applied to the parameters of the action. These predicates can be negated (not), and multiple predicates are possible using and. 1 (define (domain wumpus) (:requirements :strips) (:predicates (at ?what ?square) 5 (adj ?square-1 ?square-2) (pit ?square) (wumpus-in ?square) (have ?who ?what) (is-agent ?who) (is-wumpus ?who) 10 (is-gold ?what) (is-arrow ?what) (dead ?who) ) (:action move-agent :parameters (?who ?from ?to) 15 :precondition (and (is-agent ?who) (at ?who ?from) (adj ?from ?to) (not (pit ?to)) (not (wumpus-in ?to)) 20 ) :effect (and (not (at ?who ?from)) (at ?who ?to)) ) ;more actions: take, shoot, move-wumpus 25 ) Listing 1. Domain description in PDDL Listing 1 shows an example domain description, where predicates are defined on lines 3-11, and one possible action on lines 13-23. The predicates with one parameter can assign a property to an object (e.g. is-agent), predicates with two or more parameters give a relation between objects (e.g. at). The actions are described by the required parameters, the preconditions and effects (both expressed in terms of predicates). In the example, move-agent can only be applied to three objects if one of them is an agent (?who) on a tile (?from), ?from must be adjacent to another tile (?to) and that tile cannot be a pit and there may be no wumpus on it. When this action is applied, the agent is no longer on the first tile, but on the second. Note that in the domain description, no assignments are made. The domain only indicates the possibilities and the consequences of actions when they are applied. The actual assignments of objects and predicates are done in the problem description: 5.1.2 Problem description The problem description states which objects exist (e.g. puzzle pieces), which predicates each object satisfies (e.g. shape and initial position of the pieces) and the goal of the problem (e.g. a solved puzzle). An example problem description can be found in listing 2. The problem needs to have a name and a domain to which it applies, followed by a list of objects that exist. Next, predicates are assigned to to objects in the begin state. Finally, the goal is described with predicates. Not all objects need to be mentioned in the goal, the subset that describes the desired end state is enough. Both the list of objects and the assignment of predicates are optional. A problem without objects is hardly thinkable, but a problem with no initial predicates is: the predicates could be built up with rules, making it part of the plan. However, in most cases, both will be given. 1 (define (problem wumpus-1) (:domain wumpus) (:objects s-1-1 s-1-2 s-1-3 s-2-1 s-2-2 s-2-3 5 gold arrow agent wumpus ) (:init (adj s-1-1 s-1-2) (adj s-1-2 s-1-1) (adj s-1-2 s-1-3) (adj s-1-3 s-1-2) 10 (adj s-2-1 s-2-2) (adj s-2-2 s-2-1) (adj s-2-2 s-2-3) (adj s-2-3 s-2-2) (adj s-1-1 s-2-1) (adj s-2-1 s-1-1) (adj s-1-2 s-2-2) (adj s-2-2 s-1-2) (adj s-1-3 s-2-3) (adj s-2-3 s-1-3) 15 (is-gold gold) (at gold s-1-3) (is-agent agent) (at agent s-1-1) (is-arrow arrow) (have agent arrow) (is-wumpus wumpus)(at wumpus s-2-3) (wumpus-in s-2-3) (pit s-1-2) 20 ) (:goal (and (have agent gold) (at agent s-1-1)) ) ) Listing 2. Problem description in PDDL 5.2 Graphs in GROOVE To model all graphs and graph rules, a tool is needed. Several options are available, such as GROOVE2 , AGG3 and AUGUR4 . We chose to use GROOVE because this tool is being developed and used at the University of Twente, so there is a lot of knowledge about the internal workings of the tool. A great advantage is the built-in state space generator, which can be used to see if the model is correct and to find a plan that leads to (one of the) end state(s). The usage of the tool is very intuitive, immediately showing one of the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
