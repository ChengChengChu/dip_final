We represent it in this way: in(contb, loc1) in(conta, loc2) Reachability Tree Now, the simplest way is to use the Reachability Tree. We start with an initial state (root node), search for applicable actions for the state (edges), and then we generate the predicted states (child nodes), and we repeat the process for all child nodes until the specified depth is reached. This is the reachability tree with depth=1. None Reachability Tree \u2014 depth=1 (Image by Author) And, This is the reachability tree with depth=2. None Reachability Tree \u2014 depth=2 (Image by Author) We can see that this doesn't scale well, the number of nodes explodes when we increase the depth. Furthermore, we have not found the goal at this depth, we need to expand it further. Reachability Graph I'm sure that you think that, we can use a graph to improve it because some nodes are indeed duplicates. Here's the graph version for depth=2. None Reachability Graph \u2014 depth=2 (Image by Author) It is slightly improved, but to reach our goal (red nodes), we need depth=6, and here's how it looks like: None Reachability Graph \u2014 depth=6 (Image by Author) It's scary, isn't it? The size is really large because the level of complexity grows when we increase the depth and this becomes impractical at some point if we want to solve more complex problems. Reachability with Planning Graph The idea of the Planning Graph is the Reachability Graph with relaxations. At every depth (or also called level) it doesn't use individual states but the union of the states, so we can think that there is only one node per level. Unlike the Reachability Graph where we generate nodes by applying applicable actions, all the actions are used to generate a union of states. None Planning Graph (Image by Author) Another difference is in the Reachability Graph a state is a set of consistent propositions but in the Planning Graph, it is not. For instance in Preconditions 1 in the picture, the location of robr could be both in loc1 and loc2 simultaneously. Similarly, the actions are not always compatible, they may cancel each other's effects. In the Planning Graph, to keep track of these inconsistencies of propositions and incompatible actions we use what is called mutual exclusion (mutex). At each level we have: A set of Proposition Mutexes A set of Action Mutexes Creating Planning Graph Now, let's see how to build a Planning Graph step-by-step. Initially, we have Level 0 which has only Preconditions 0 in it, which is equal to the initial state. Level 0 (Image by Author) Next, we build the next level, Level 1. Start with a set of actions: Building A1 (Image by Author) What this equation means is that A1 is a set of actions whose: Preconditions are satisfied by the current state, and There is no pair of its preconditions in the Proposition Mutexes The next step is to build a set of propositions: None Building P1 (Image by Author) We take the previously built A1 and create a union of the positive effects of all the actions. The next two steps are to build the mutexes, start with mutexes for A1: None Building Mutexes for A1 (Image by Author) Two actions in A1 are mutex if they are dependent (they cancel each other's effects) or their preconditions are in mutexes for P0. Two actions are dependent if there is a negative effect that will cancel precondition of positive effects of an action: None Dependent actions (Image by Author) The final step is to build mutexes for P1: None Building Mutexes for P1 This basically means that a pair of propositions in P1 are mutex if: In all pair of actions in A1 that has them as positive effects, those actions are mutex, and There is no single action in A1 that can produce both Now, this is quite complex, but the step can be simply repeated for the next levels. Here is the result of the Planning Graph with depth=3. None Planning Graph \u2014 depth=3 At this point we can see that the Planning Graph is much more complex to build compared to the Reachability Tree and the Reachability Graph, but as you can see it will be faster in search time and lower in size, and more importantly easier for us to analyze or debug. Another important point when building a Planning Graph is that, after some depths, it will be fixed, meaning that the set of Actions and set of Propositions won't change any further. Our goal is reached at level 3, we can see that both propositions: in(contb, loc1) in(conta, loc2) are in P3 (see in the picture above). Searching the Planning Graph Now that we have our Planning Graph \u2014 the data structure, we can use a search algorithm to find the solution plan for our planning problem. A plan in this approach is not a sequence of actions, but instead a set of sequence of actions. All actions in the set of a level can be executed independently \u2014 that means there are no ordering constraints between them. The search is performed backward from P3 to P0 in our example, recursively to solve all propositions in the goal. After we have solved them, we recursively use the preconditions of the actions as sub-goal until we reach P0. None Searching Backwards (Image by Author) One important thing that we skipped was that at every level we have Dummy Actions that do nothing \u2014 their preconditions and effects are the same. This allows the algorithm to work smoothly for those propositions that are already satisfied in the lower level.
