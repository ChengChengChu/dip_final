The eraser rule should reference to that level indicator, resulting in the desired behavior. Each eraser needs its own, unique quantifier node to ensure they are matched independently. Figure 7a shows the \u2018simple\u2019 approach, figure 7b shows the rule with an existential quantifier. The extra node is shown as \u2203 ? z, the label of the eraser edge reads b@z. Another solution for this phenomenon would be to create two rules for each action: one with eraser and one without. This way, it is always possible to apply either one :precondition ( (a ?A ?B) ) :effect ( not (b ?A ?B) ) Listing 3. PDDL code of a negative effect A B a b (a) simple approach B A \u2203 ? z a b@z (b) solution Figure 7. Graph rules of an eraser of these rules, and by giving them the same transition label, the resulting plan makes no difference between them, making both rules appear as one and the same. We chose not to use this method, because the system could become quite cluttered with two or more rules per action. Moreover, constructions like this are more difficult to detect when one would want to translate the graph transformation system back to PDDL. Another difference between PDDL and graphs is \u2018injective matching\u2019 of objects. PDDL matches the parameters of an actions distinctively, i.e. all the used objects are unique. By default, GROOVE does not do this and one node in a graph can be used multiple times in a single rule. Fortunately, GROOVE has a setting to prevent this: injective matching should be turned on in the resulting graphs for the rules to behave the same as the PDDL actions. 6.2 Testing To validate this approach, we made PDDL descriptions of a state, and for every atomic action the state that followed after applying each action. We translated these states and actions to graphs and graph rules using the suggested translation method. To put this in a formal way: Given translation T, from planner states to graphs and actions to graph rules. T(S) is the graph corresponding to state S, T(A) is the rule corresponding to action A. To test translation T, an action a is chosen and applied to a state s0, resulting in a state s1: s0 a\u2192 s1. These states and action are translated using T, resulting in graphs T(s0) and T(s1), and graph rule T(a). If T is to be called correct for this action a, the rule application of T(a) on graph T(s0) should result in graph T(s1): T(s0) T (a) \u2192 T(s1) T is considered correct if this holds for every action a. See figure 8 for a visual representation of the test plan. We performed this test on 12 test cases: A rule can have positive and negative preconditions, and it can have positive and negative effects. All the possibilities to combine are shown in table 1. All actions were applied to a state with two objects; A and B, with the predicate a from A to s0 T , T(s0) a T , \u000f\u000f T(a) \u000f\u000f s1 T , T(s1) Figure 8. Correctness of the translation. The squares on the left are planner states, the circles on the right are graph states. The solid vertical arrows are action- and rule applications and the dotted horizontal arrows are translations Table 1. Numbers of the test cases: + for positive preconditions/effects, \u2212 for negative, \u00b1 for both test case Preconditions + \u2212 \u00b1 Effects 1 2 3 + 4 5 6 \u2212 7 8 9 \u00b1 10 11 12 B. We translated all actions to graph rules, applied those on the graph that corresponds with the start state and checked whether the result was similar to the result state. For example: Test 4a & 4b For all tests as of number 4, we figured there are multiple possibilities to implement the tests: When using multiple predicates in a rule, they can apply on the different relations between the objects (e.g. test 4a, below), or on the same (e.g. test 4b, below). The graph rules of both 4a and 4b are shown in figure 9a and 9b. 4a 4b :precondition ( (a ?A ?B) ) :effect ( (b ?A ?B) ) :precondition ( (a ?A ?B) ) :effect ( (a ?A ?B) ) A B a b (a) test 4a A B a a (b) test 4b Figure 9. Graph rules of test 4 Test 10b As can be seen in listing 5, this action has two contradicting effects, which does not work in PDDL. Therefor, his action cannot be translated. 6.3 Results Except for the issue mentioned above, the tests show that the approach appears to be correct, because the generated :precondition ( (a ?A ?B) ) :effect ( and((b ?A ?B) not (b ?A ?B)) ) Listing 4. PDDL code with two contradicting effects graph rules for all other actions were applicable to the first graph and resulted in the respective end graphs. To fully test the possibilities, we have designed and built a compiler that reads PDDL-files into GROOVE, automatically representing the problem with graphs and graph rules. To test the compiler, we made GROOVE to come up with a plan for the wumpus problem as described in listing 1 and\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GROOVE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GROOVE is a graph transformation tool used for modeling and analyzing systems, particularly in the context of translating PDDL actions to graph rules.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PDDL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) is a formal language used for expressing planning problems and actions in artificial intelligence.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>A<|>PERSON<|>A is a placeholder object used in the context of the tests to represent one of the entities involved in the actions being tested.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>B<|>PERSON<|>B is another placeholder object used in the context of the tests to represent the second entity involved in the actions being tested.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEST CASES<|>EVENT<|>Test cases are specific scenarios designed to validate the correctness of the translation from PDDL to graph rules.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STATE<|>EVENT<|>A state represents a specific configuration of objects and their relationships at a given point in time during the testing process.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACTION<|>EVENT<|>An action refers to a specific operation or rule applied to a state that results in a transition to a new state.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GROOVE<|>PDDL<|>GROOVE translates PDDL actions into graph rules for modeling and analysis<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>A<|>B<|>A and B are used as objects in the test cases to demonstrate the application of actions and rules<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEST CASES<|>STATE<|>Test cases are designed to validate the correctness of state transitions resulting from actions<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STATE<|>ACTION<|>An action is applied to a state to produce a new state in the testing process<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
