This is a valid action because the start graph satisfies the reader but not the embargo. By applying the rule, edge b is deleted and edge r is created, resulting in the graph in figure 2b. 3. PROBLEM STATEMENT a c b r (a) rule A B C D a c r (b) result Figure 2. An example graph rule and transformation, starting with the graph in figure 1 To design and build a translator that combines the best of the two worlds, we address the following questions: 1. How can problem descriptions in PDDL and graph transformation systems be translated correctly? \u2022 How can problem descriptions in PDDL be translated correctly into graph transformation systems? \u2022 How can graph transformation systems be translated correctly into a domain and problem descriptions in PDDL? 2. When can a translation be called \u2018correct\u2019? 3. How can a translation be implemented in GROOVE? We define the relation between PDDL and graph transformation systems: what do they haven in common, what are the differences? We show how we use that common ground and work around some of the differences, and list the limitations of the translations. Products. As part of the research, we have produced a translator that uses all the results of these questions. By incorporating this translator into GROOVE, the tool will be able to handle PDDL descriptions as input. A graph transformation system will automatically be generated from the description and the user can work with it as if it were a graph system he built himself. This way, existing PDDL descriptions can be visualized, edited and improved. As for the other way around, graph transformation systems (both generated and hand-made) can be exported to a PDDL description. Traditional planners can use their heuristic search algorithms to quickly explore the state space, so larger and more complex problems can be solved within reasonable time. 4. RELATED WORK Not much research has been done in the relation between graphs and planning, but the following works are somewhat related: \u2022 Edelkamp [1] already explored the possibilities of using PDDL for model checking software and measured some promising performance results. His translations were done manually. \u2022 Hegedus et. al. [10] described a framework to explore the state space of graph transformation systems using heuristic search. They also measured great performance increase compared to \u2018normal\u2019 state space exploration. \u2022 Hegedus et. al. [11] also developed a guided trajectory exploration algorithm based on the results of petri net [12] analysis. This again shows the potential of heuristic algorithms to explore a state space of graph transformation systems. \u2022 Estler et. al. [4] have build a planning framework that uses heuristic search algorithms to direct the search in a state space of graph-based systems. \u2022 Gerevini and Long [6] described the PDDL language with a BNF grammar, which is one of the first steps towards building the translator. \u2022 Snippe [14] researched the possibility of using A* search to find a path to the end state in GROOVE. This algorithm was not implemented, but the relevance of a heuristic search to explore the state space was shown once again. 5. DETAILS To explain the translation, we need to zoom in on the details of PDDL and graph transformation systems. For both, we will use \u2018wumpus world\u2019 as an example, a commonly used problem to get used to planning systems and their terminology. Wumpus is a generic \u2018bad guy\u2019 that guards a treasure. The purpose of this problem is to move an agent through a simple maze, defeat the wumpus with a spear, gather the treasure and move back to the starting point. A visual representation of this problem is shown in figure 3. The PDDL code used for these examples is derived from the examples of Patrik Haslum1 . Figure 3. Visual representation of the wumpus world. The agent, carrying a spear, is in the top left corner, the wumpus in the bottom right, and the treasure in the top right. A possible plan to solve this problem is to move the agent down and right, shoot his spear at the wumpus (killing it), move right and up, take the treasure and walk back (down, left, left, up). 5.1 PDDL PDDL uses a strict separation between the domain description and the problem description, both of which will be discussed separately. An important principle in both is predicates. Predicates can assign properties to objects, and define relations between objects; for example the predicate dead, which puts a label on an object indicating it is considered dead, or have, which states that one object is in possession of another. 5.1.1 Domain description The domain description describes the possible actions and their effects. It consists of the following parts: Domain name The definition of the domain name; used to refer to the domain. List of requirements Some AI planners might support more features than basic STRIPS (e.g. typing of objects) and to indicate whether the description uses 1http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~patrik/ pddlman/wumpus.html these extra features, a list of \u2018requirements\u2019 is added to the domain description. If no requirements are given, STRIPS is implied. List of predicates with each predicate denoting the possible properties of, and relations between objects in the domain. List of actions The possible actions are described with their names, parameters, preconditions and effects. Both the preconditions and the effects are optional: an action without preconditions can always be applied, an action without effects doesn\u2019t change anything but only checks whether some conditions are true. Both the preconditions and the effects are described in terms of predicates, applied to the parameters of the action. These predicates can be negated\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
