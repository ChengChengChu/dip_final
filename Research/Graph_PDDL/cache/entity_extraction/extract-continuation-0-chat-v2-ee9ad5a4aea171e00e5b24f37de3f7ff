See section 5.1 for more details about PDDL. Edelkamp and Rensink [2] suggested that these two fields are more related than one would think, and graph transformation systems could be used to solve planning problems. Edelkamp [1] already explored the possibilities of using PDDL for model checking software and measured some promising performance results. Although he did the translations between graphs and PDDL manually, a translation has been proven possible and useful. Several examples of PDDL were translated to graphs and several models (represented as graphs) were translated into PDDL descriptions. In this paper, we describe a tool to do this automatically. Building an automated translation will combine the intuitive workings of graph-based modeling and solving with the heuristic exploration algorithms of traditional planners that rely on PDDL input. 1.2 Paper outline In section 2, we will introduce the basic concepts of PDDL and graph transformations. In section 3, we will elaborate on the problem and what we want to achieve with this paper, followed by a survey of related work in section 4. In section 5, we will zoom in on the details of both PDDL and grapsh, followed by the description of the translation from PDDL to graphs in section 6. Section 7 will describe the translation the other way around. To conclude, the conclusion in section 8 contains a reflection: what do this research and translator contribute, and what is still left to do? The appendices consist of a list of definitions (A) that might help while reading, the graphs generated during the tests (B), the graphs used as input for the tests (C) and the generated PDDL output (D). 2. BACKGROUND 2.1 PDDL PDDL is an acronym for Planning Domain Definition Language [7], and was an attempt to standardize AI planning languages. It was inspired by several forebears such as STRIPS [5] and ADL [13], and developed in 1998. By default, PDDL uses STRIPS syntax to describe both the domain and the problem (discussed in section 5.1). STRIPS uses preconditions and effects to describe possible actions. Some planners support more features, called requirements, like typing or quantified preconditions. This paper is limited to the basic STRIPS functionality. A piece of example code can be found in section 5.1, where we will discuss the syntax. Using the PDDL description as input, planners can try to find a solution for the described problem. The format of the output is not specified, but it is usually a fully or partially ordered plan: a sequence of events (the application of an action, indicating which parameters are used) which will lead from the initial state to the goal. 2.2 Graphs A B C D a b c Figure 1. An example graph A graph G can be defined as a 3-tuple: G = hV, E, Li, with V being a set of nodes (sometimes called vertices) and E being a set of edges, represented as a 3-tuple with a source node, a label and a destination node: (vsrc, l, vdst). Finally, L is the complete set of labels that the edges have. Labels of nodes are represented by a self-edge of that node. All this can easily be represented visually by drawing the nodes as boxes, and the edges as arrows from node to node. The following formal description corresponds to the example graph in figure 1. V = {0, 1, 2, 3} E = {(0, A, 0),(1, B, 1),(2, C, 2),(3, D, 3), (0, a, 2),(0, b, 3),(1, c, 3)} L = {A, B, C, D, a, b, c} The set of labels could be split up into a set of node-labels and a set of edge-labels. In the example figure however, node labels are just syntactic sugar for self-edges. 2.2.1 Graph transformation To model changes in a non-static environment, it is necessary to change the graph accordingly. Changes in graphs using formal rules are called transformations. Transformations are used in modeling software and hardware systems. The formal rules to change a graph consist of nodes and edges, labeled as one of these four types: Readers Edges and nodes that must be present to make a rule applicable, shown as a plain black (continuous thin) edge. Embargoes Edges and nodes which presence prevents the rule from being applied, shown red (dashed fat). Creators Edges and nodes that will be created when the rule is applied, shown green (continuous fat). Erasers Edges and nodes that will be deleted when the rule is applied, shown as a blue (dashed thin) edge. These terms and colors are specific to GROOVE, the tool we use to model graph transformation systems (discussed later), but all graph transformations systems work with the same principle. An example rule is shown in figure 2a. a is a reader, b an eraser, c an embargo and r a creator. In figure 2 the rule is applied to the example graph (figure 1). This is a valid action because the start graph satisfies the reader but not the embargo. By applying the rule, edge b is deleted and edge r is created, resulting in the graph in figure 2b. 3.
