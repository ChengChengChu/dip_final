We chose to use GROOVE because this tool is being developed and used at the University of Twente, so there is a lot of knowledge about the internal workings of the tool. A great advantage is the built-in state space generator, which can be used to see if the model is correct and to find a plan that leads to (one of the) end state(s). The usage of the tool is very intuitive, immediately showing one of the powers of graph models. The tool divides the case into a start graph and graph rules. The rules can be prioritized, so that certain rules will never be applied if other rules can be. For example, the pattern of the desired end state can be formulated as a rule with the highest priority, so no more rules will be applied if the graph matches this state. Figure 4 shows a graph representation of the problem described in listing 2. All objects are represented as nodes, the predicates are shown as edges between them. The object names are shown inside the nodes, as node labels. Properties of the nodes are shown as proper self-edges, 2groove.cs.utwente.nl 3user.cs.tu-berlin.de/~gragra/agg 4www.fmi.uni-stuttgart.de/szs/tools/augur just for clarity.

Graph representation of the move-agent action in GROOVE A closer look learns that there is only one possible match of the rule to the start graph: the agent could move from sq-1-1 to sq-2-1. State Space. One of the biggest advantages of GROOVE is the built-in state space generator. This view represents each possible graph of the system as a node, and each transition (rule application) as an edge. A rule application r on graph g0 which leads to graph g1 is displayed as g0 r\u2192 g1. There are several methods to explore the state space, like manually, depth-first, breadth-first and some (semi-)random algorithms. The complete state space can give a quick insight into the correctness of the model by looking for the presence of deadlock-states (no more possible actions), or the solution of the problem by finding (a) final state(s). The path toward such states can easily be followed to see where the real problem is. Each node can be clicked to see the corresponding graph. 6. TRANSLATION PDDL TO GRAPHS We will now describe the translation from PDDL to a graph transformation system in GROOVE. First we will explain the theoretical background for reasoning about its correctness (section 6.1), followed by a test plan and the results (section 6.2 and 6.2). 6.1 Theory The way PDDL splits up problems into a domain definition and a problem definition very much resembles the way graph transformation systems are represented. In GROOVE in particular, there is a clear division between the rules (domain) and the start graph (problem). This similarity makes the translation fairly simple. The predicates are easy to translate into edges: a self-edge for predicates with only one argument, an edge between two nodes for two arguments and an extra node with multiple edges to multiple existing nodes for predicates with three or more arguments. An example of these translations can be seen in figure 6. A a (a) one parameter(a A) A B a (b) two parameters (a A B) A B C a 0 1 2 (c) more parameters (a A B C) Figure 6. Example basic translations The actions can all be translated to graph transformation rules by interpreting the preconditions as readers and embargoes, and the effects as creators and erasers, except for one difference: An eraser in GROOVE acts as a reader at the same time, allowing the rule application only when that edge is present. PDDL however, applies the action regardless of the presence of the predicate that is to be deleted. This might seem to cause no problems, as the result is the same. The resulting plan would differ between the systems however, and if the action/rule would include another effect, this action would produce another state than the corresponding rule. The desired behavior of the rule would be to erase the relation if present, but also apply the rule if it is not, as this is how PDDL is specified. GROOVE supports a feature that does this, using existential quantifiers. This feature is well-documented for nodes, but not so much for edges. The solution is to introduce a new quantifier node with a certain level indicator. The eraser rule should reference to that level indicator, resulting in the desired behavior. Each eraser needs its own, unique quantifier node to ensure they are matched independently. Figure 7a shows the \u2018simple\u2019 approach, figure 7b shows the rule with an existential quantifier. The extra node is shown as \u2203 ? z, the label of the eraser edge reads b@z. Another solution for this phenomenon would be to\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
