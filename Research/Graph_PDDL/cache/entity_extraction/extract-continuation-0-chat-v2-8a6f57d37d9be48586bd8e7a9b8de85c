Combining two Worlds with a Translator Ronald Meijer University of Twente P.O. Box 217, 7500AE Enschede The Netherlands r.m.meijer-1@student.utwente.nl ABSTRACT This paper describes how the AI planning language PDDL was combined with a graph-based model checking tool called GROOVE. Graph-based models are very intuitive to work with, yet powerful enough to deal with a great variety of problems. The visual representation provides a quick insight in the workings of a model and the available tools allows the user to explore the system with great ease. The built-in state space generator of GROOVE comes in handy during the analysis of a problem and its solution. Traditional PDDL planners on the other hand are specialized in finding a solution without exploring the complete state space. This approach can be necessary for problems which state space is just too big to fully explore. Both approaches have shown to be useful, and the translator we built combines the forces of both: it makes for an easy interpretation of traditional planning problems formulated in PDDL, and exploration process for graph transformation systems with a big state space can be accelerated with an export to PDDL. Keywords PDDL, GROOVE, planning, graphs, translation 1. INTRODUCTION 1.1 Motivation Graph transformations have shown to be a successful technique for modeling software and hardware systems, and they have a rich formal foundation for reasoning about them. To model changes in systems, graphs can be transformed by deleting existing nodes and edges, or creating new ones. Many types of transformations are formalized [3], and are flexible enough to deal with a great variety of models [8]. The visual representation of graphs makes it easy to gain a quick insight into the essence of a model. See section 5.2 for more details about graphs and graph transformation. AI planners are tools, optimized to find the quickest solution to problems using heuristic search algorithms.

One language for doing this is PDDL [7], which describes both the problem and the domain in a formal way. See section 5.1 for more details about PDDL. Edelkamp and Rensink [2] suggested that these two fields are more related than one would think, and graph transformation systems could be used to solve planning problems. Edelkamp [1] already explored the possibilities of using PDDL for model checking software and measured some promising performance results. Although he did the translations between graphs\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>RONALD MEIJER<|>PERSON<|>Ronald Meijer is a researcher at the University of Twente, focusing on AI planning and graph transformations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF TWENTE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The University of Twente is an educational institution in Enschede, Netherlands, where research on AI planning and graph transformations is conducted.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PDDL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PDDL is an AI planning language used for describing planning problems in a formal way.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GROOVE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GROOVE is a graph-based model checking tool that allows for the analysis of problems and solutions through graph transformations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENSCHEDE<|>GEO<|>Enschede is a city in the Netherlands, home to the University of Twente.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>17TH TWENTE STUDENT CONFERENCE ON IT<|>EVENT<|>The 17th Twente Student Conference on IT is an academic event held at the University of Twente, focusing on information technology topics.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RONALD MEIJER<|>UNIVERSITY OF TWENTE<|>Ronald Meijer is affiliated with the University of Twente as a researcher<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PDDL<|>GROOVE<|>PDDL and GROOVE are both tools used in the field of AI planning and graph transformations<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF TWENTE<|>17TH TWENTE STUDENT CONFERENCE ON IT<|>The 17th Twente Student Conference on IT is hosted by the University of Twente<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RONALD MEIJER<|>17TH TWENTE STUDENT CONFERENCE ON IT<|>Ronald Meijer presented his research at the 17th Twente Student Conference on IT<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ENSCHEDE<|>UNIVERSITY OF TWENTE<|>The University of Twente is located in Enschede, Netherlands<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
